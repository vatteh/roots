# roots

A web app to discover the past influencers of current top musicians.
Data fetched from Spotify and Rovi APIs.
Angular, Angular Material, SCSS, Node/Express & Gulp.
A live version can be seen at https://rootsdiscovery.herokuapp.com/

Started as a hackathon submission by Victor Atteh and Alex Liu, and was then fleshed out by me afterwards using Angular Material.
